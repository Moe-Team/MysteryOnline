[u]Introduction:[/u]

MO is a fancy IRC client that lets you chat in a VN format, All characters and locations are optional with the exception of RedHerring, Narrator and the Hakuryou location.

Adding new content is as simple as dropping a folder in the corresponding category folder (example: a character will go in the characters folder), see the wiki for more details on creating new characters.

[u]Protips:[/u]

Right clicking on the main screen gives you a right click menu (might seem obvious but some people miss it.) which gives you quick access to a lot of features and the settings.

While on the userlist, clicking on one of the users will let you know the character they're using as well as their location and sublocation.

Characters, sublocations and sfx can be added to a favorite list for easier access in the settings.

While on character select, you can right click any character to quickly add them to your favorites.

Creating your own server is as simple as editing irc_channel_name.ini.

rules.txt and and help.txt can also be customised as you see fit for your own server or version of MO.

If you start a message with >, It will be automatically greentexted.
